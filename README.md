# 🎨 linux_themeings  

My personal Linux theming setup for **Hyprland**, **Waybar**, **Kitty**, and **Fastfetch** — all kept in sync with a single `.zshrc` script for theme switching.  
Everything’s designed to be minimal, fast, and easy to set up on any Arch-based or Debian-based distro.

## ✨ Features
- Unified theming across **Hyprland**, **Waybar**, **Kitty**, and **Fastfetch**
- Automatic theme switching from `.zshrc`
- Installer script that:
  - backs up your old configs  
  - copies everything into the right places  
  - checks your distro  
  - installs missing dependencies automatically (optional)
- Simple layout that’s easy to customize
